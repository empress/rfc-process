# RFC Process

RFC Process is an [Empress](https://github.com/empress) project designed to display RFCs for a community project and track them through their lifecycle from idea to implementation. RFC Process was originally built to track the [EmberJS RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs) and will be closely aligned with the [RFC Stages RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0617-rfc-stages.md)

While this project is originally being implemented specifically for EmberJS, as with all Empress projects it is designed for you to easily be able to reuse and even implement a template that better matches your project's designs.


## Quick Start

```
npx ember-cli@latest new my-rfcs

cd my-rfcs

# you can replace the template with the one you want to use
npx ember install rfc-process rfc-process-mdbook-template
```
