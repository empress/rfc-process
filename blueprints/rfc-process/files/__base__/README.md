# RFC Process

Welcome! You are now looking at some test data for [RFC Process](https://github.com/empress/rfc-process), a project to display your RFCs and keep track of the whole process from ideation to completion! This was first built to track the [EmberJS RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs) and is designed to allow any project that has the concept of an RFC to re-use the tooling.

There are some dummy RFCs in this repo to show you what this looks like but when you use this yourself you will likely have a lot more data to work with!
